# Adding a new Player

There are multiple ways what one could understand as "creating a new player" in descent from arkovs Tower. Therefore I will list the steps which I will explain here.

# Creating the Paladine
The Player character which we will create will be the paladine. Undead enemies are scared of him and might randomly fly or get stunned by his presencce. Other than that the palandine can wear armor (like the knight), drink potions and use ranged (stones / javelins) and multi tile weapons (like the hammer).

Steps:
1. create new player visibles (including weapons and armor) for a paladin character
2. make a new player character using only the visibles, rest is a copy of the knight
3. adjust some values in the players config
4. adapt some code so that undead enemies (skeletons, ghosts, skully) have a chance of fleeing from the paladin
