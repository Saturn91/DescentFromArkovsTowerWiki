## Content

## Summary
Modding in Descent from Akrov's tower is intended to be straight forward. You can simply start the game and will find an Option "Mods" in the main menu which leads you to the Modmanager. The ModManager is where you can:
1. [create new mods](mod-creation.md)
2. [subscribing / installing mods from the steam workshop](steam-workshop/steam-workshop-index.md)
3. [Push your own Mods to the Workshop](publish-mods/index.md).

> Disclaimer: MAC Users do not have access to the Workshop from in game...
