Descent from Arkov's Tower uses the Steamworkshop available to acquire and share mods. This is a service which Steam offers to all its customers.

In the following Section you will learn how you can download mods, and how to make your mods available on the Workshop for other users.

This mod is now available on your computer, but not yet ready to play. In order to enable the mod, you need to select it. In the Dropdown you then "enable" the mod. Alternatively, you can enable it using the checkbox. In both cases, it should afterwards look like the picture below.
